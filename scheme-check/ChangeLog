	* Added new file paper-examples.ss, with most examples of the
	QuickCheck paper ported to Scheme-Check.

	* Cleaned up comments: most contracts now use proper PLT syntax.

	* Fixed problem with gen-do macro, redesigned oneof and frequency
	to support recursive type generators (wrapped delay/force around
	stuff).
